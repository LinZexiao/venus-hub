### Venus Deal Accelerator

Venus is committed to offer a fully functional deal-making experience for both storage clients and storage providers on scale. As Filecoin network grows and the community strive towards a more storage deal weighted growth than committed capacity growth, Venus community takes on the challenge to help shape this vision with the Venus Deal Accelerator program.

The goal of Venus Deal Accelerator program is to distribute as much storage deals as it can to the broader storage provider community with focuses on seamlessly bridging the sealing experience that storage providers are already familiar with to the Filecoin deal taking experience. Venus Deal Accelerator program will be responsible for applying large datacap with approved open datasets from [fil-plus](https://filecoinproject.slack.com/archives/C01DLAPKDGX) program and distribute storage deals to its participants running Venus storage systems.

We look forward to see you in the program!
