Those ones who successfully deployed Venus on Calibration will be assigned to help some SPs in Venus Incubator to earn a quite part of the reward. However, a Venus Master can still support the community by simply answering questions in Venus community channels, participating in Venus Meetup or reporting issues&discussions on Github to earn the program reward. ## Requirements and rewards- Phase 2 Master Count: 12- Minimum Effective Service Period: 90 days- Reward Amount: up to 5,000USD for each Master- Service objectives and reward distribution standard: | Objective   | Percentage | Reward(USD) || ----------------- | -- | -- || Pass Venus Course    | 1%  | 50 || Deployment of Venus on Calibration    | 4%  | 200 || Community Channel Activity    | 20%  | 1,000 || Issues (from testing/support/prod) and discussions on Github    | 20%  | 1,000 || 1on1 Incubation SPs support   | 40%  | 2,000 || Outstanding Service Bonus  | 15%  | 750 || Total    | 100%  | 5,000 |## Recruiting period- From: Mar 25th, 2022- To: Sep 25th, 2022## Links- Venus Course: [link](https://venus.filecoin.io/master/)- Application Formï¼š[link](http://venusteam.mikecrm.com/KWWYu0F)- Contact: [link](/contact)
